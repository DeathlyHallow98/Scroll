# Scroll
Changes scroll direction macOS instantly.
The natural scroll direction for an external mouse is different than that of a trackpad.
Changing this setting everytime I used a mouse made the process tedious, so I wrote this script which if saved as an application works instantly when clicked or ran through terminal
